**Objective:** Today, we centered on understanding Test-Driven Development (TDD) and its practical implementation. We applied this methodology to two different cases, reinforcing the practice of writing tests before coding. Emphasis was placed on creating clear, incremental tests that drive coding decisions.

**Reflective**: enlightening

**Interpretive**: Adopting TDD introduced a different approach to problem-solving, shifting my mindset toward anticipating outcomes before writing any code. Despite my initial unfamiliarity, this practice offered a structured framework that I found valuable and engaging.

**Decision**: I will incorporate TDD in future coding exercises to solidify my understanding and build more reliable code.
